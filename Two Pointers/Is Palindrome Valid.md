# Is Palindrome Valid

A palindrome is a sequence of characters that **reads the same forward and backward.**

Given a string, **determine if it's a palindrome** after removing all non-alphanumeric characters. A character is alphanumeric if it's either a letter or a number.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: st = 'a dog! a panic in a pagoda.'
Output: True
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: st = 'abc123'
Output: False
```

**Constraints:**
- The string may include a combination of lowercase English letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuations.
