# Pair Sum - Unsorted

Given an array of integers, return the indexes of **any two numbers that add up to a target**. The order of the indexes in the result doesn't matter. If no pair is found, return an empty array.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [-1, 3, 4, 2], target = 3
Output: [0, 2]
```
Explanation: `nums[0] + nums[2] = -1 + 4 = 3`

**Constraints:**
- The same index cannot be used twice in the result.
